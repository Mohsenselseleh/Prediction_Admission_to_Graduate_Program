# Prediction_Admission_to_Graduate_Program
We are interested to see how variables, such as GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores), GPA (grade point average) and prestige of the undergraduate institution, effect admission into graduate school at UCLA. The data for this analysis is collected from (http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/). The admit variable, admit/not admitted, is a binary variable.
